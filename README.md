## Description 
![portfolio](assets/images/Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 5.32.22 PM.png)
I built this project to discover new recipes and add the contents to a list that shows me what grocery store near me offers the best price for the bulk of the items. It also creates a recipe in my fitness pall and records the macros to it.  I'm a meal planning fanatic and I need this in my life.
