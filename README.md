## Purpose
This project generates read-me.md files using CLI.  User answers questions about their project and based on user input a polished read-me file is generated and saved.  This application is intended to increase user productivity and efficiency by creating formatting automatically.  

## Install
Clone this repository and run the application with the command line. 
node index.js will runn application.

## Usage

User will be prompted to answer the following items:
1. What is your project name
2. Enter description
3. Enter License
4. Steps required for install
5. Instructions and examples for use
6. Collaborators 
7. Third party assets
8. tutorials
9. License description
10. Screenshots
11. Github user id
12. Github link
13. email address
14. How can others contribute
15. How to test project

After entries a markdown file will be created with a header, table of contents, installation, usage, credits, license, contributing, tests, and questions sections. The user can use this as many times as desired, however it is recommended that after each read-me is generated, the user save the file, because it will be over-written upon next use.
